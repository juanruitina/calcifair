# Calcifer

Calcifer is the [resident fire demon](https://howlscastle.fandom.com/wiki/Calcifer) of a Raspberry Pi located in Madrid, Spain. It captures relevant environmental information from their sensors and shows alerts when things go wrong. Calcifer is written in Python.

## Hardware

For now Calcifer runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB RAM) with Raspbian, and the following hardware, all bought from [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/):

- **SGP-30 Air Quality Sensor Breakout**, for equivalent CO2 and volatile organic compounds (TVOC) readings.
- **ST7789 1.3" SPI Colour LCD screen**, with 240Ã—240 resolution.
- **LTR-559 Light and Proximity Sensor Breakout**, so Calcifer's screen turns on whenever I put my hand close to them.
- **Breakout Garden** (I2C + SPI).

Make sure to install all the drivers from Pimoroni.

## Licences

- My installation makes use of images and animated GIFs from the "Howl's Moving Castle" feature film by Studio Ghibli. I downloaded them from Giphy, Tenor, or elsewhere. Since they are probably copyrighted, I have removed them from the repo.
  - Whichever image you use, make sure it's squared.
  - Have a look at the `calcifer_expressions()` function and rewrite it as needed to avoid errors.

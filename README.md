# Calcifer

Calcifer is the [resident fire demon](https://howlscastle.fandom.com/wiki/Calcifer) of a Raspberry Pi located in Madrid, Spain. It captures relevant environmental information from their sensors and shows alerts when things go wrong. Calcifer is written in Python.

## Hardware

For now Calcifer runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB RAM) with Raspberry, and the following hardware, all bought from [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/):

* SGP-30 Air Quality Sensor Breakout, for equivalent CO2 and volatile organic compounds (TVOC) readings
* 1.3" SPI Colour LCD screen, with a 240Ã—240 resolution.
* LTR-559 Light and Proximity Sensor Breakout, so Calcifer's screen turns on whenever I put my hand close to them

Make sure to install all the drivers from Pimoroni.
